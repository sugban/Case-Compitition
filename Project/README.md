## Datasets
Datasets are given in two different categories:
* Overweight and Obesity data
* Datasets from Worldbank - Social, educational, economic, cultural, and environmental factors data

### Process
* We cleaned and prepared the data using Python.
* We started off by narrowing it down by looking at children with highest BMI rate & the most populated country to get the higher impact of the program.
* We checked the co-relation with different socital factors effecting the BMI rate among children.
* We vizualized datasets through Power BI.
* We looked at each external factors when determining which country to choose, and finally moved further with;
  - The projected obesity rate 2030 
  - Healthy Diet Costs
  - Broadband and Mobile Subscriptions
  

### Solution
We concluded that Novo Nordisk should launch the program in *United States*.
